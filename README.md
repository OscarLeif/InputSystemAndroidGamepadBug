[ANDROID] GAMEPAD INPUT GETS STUCK IF BOTH THE D-PAD AND SOUTH BUTTON IS PRESSED AT THE SAME TIME

How to reproduce:
1. Open the project
2. In the Build Settings "Run Device" dropdown, select the desired device
3. Press Build And Run
4. Connect the Gamepad to the device
5. In the Player on the Gamepad press the D-Pad (left or right buttons) and at the same time press the South button

Expected result: Cube moves as long as the D-Pad is pressed and stops once released
Actual result: D-Pad gets stuck and cubes move after the D-Pad and South button are released
